This dir holds automatically generated tab-delimited text files,
containing IDs and summary statistics for groups of subjects.

The files are generated by this function---
    subFx_analysis/txtOutput.m
---as configured at the top of anGrp.m

This enables subject-level summary statistics to be handed off for 
further analyses (e.g., with subject-level covariates).
